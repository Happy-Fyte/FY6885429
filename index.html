        Augmented reality (AR) is an emerging technology in the digital media space where images, videos, sounds, or 3D models can be overlayed onto the real world in real time through our smart devices. 
        Many examples of it’s application have been very successful like through games like Pokémon GO where 3D models of the Pokémon would be rendered into the real world to allow for a seamless experience leading to it becoming an instant hit. 
        A recent development in AR was through the consumerism base through implementing products for sale in 3D models so that people can interact with the product they are buying without physically being at the store to pick it up and use it. 
        Recently, AR has expanded into retail, allowing consumers to interact with 3D models of products before purchasing. 
        This lets shoppers virtually explore items in their own environments, enhancing the online shopping experience by making it more immersive and informative even without visiting a store in person. 
        In the beauty industry specifically this has been a major development as beauty products.

      The theory is that with online shopping its harder to actually feel and touch their products and AR brings the closest experience to in person shopping to online shopping for these kind of beauty products therefore reflecting the products quality better than just the normal way e commerce websites usually market their products

    Cognitive control has a big impact on peoples experience with Augmented Reality

“With social media, consumers might have more chances to attain other consumers’ opinions and understand the situation based on their peers’ opinions. In other words, if others give opinions that help consumers understand the product or services, consumers' cognitive control might be increased. Therefore, Study 2 sets a situation where consumers are given positive peer opinion (i.e., high cognitive control) and investigates the relationship between AR experience and consumer purchase intention.”

A combination of peers’ opinions and cognitive control effect the AR experience and affect purchase intention.

Which results in a conclusion that AR experiences help consumers understand and predict the performance of a product better than normal e commerce marketing methods so that the cognitive control increases thus increasing purchase intention.

The study was only done on lipstick, a female product therefore no gender effect was considered
