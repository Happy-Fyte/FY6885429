        Augmented reality (AR) is an emerging technology in the digital media space where images, videos, sounds, or 3D models can be overlayed onto the real world in real time through our smart devices. 
        Many examples of it’s application have been very successful like through games like Pokémon GO where 3D models of the Pokémon would be rendered into the real world to allow for a seamless experience leading to it becoming an instant hit. 
        A recent development in AR was through the consumerism base through implementing products for sale in 3D models so that people can interact with the product they are buying without physically being at the store to pick it up and use it. 
        Recently, AR has expanded into retail, allowing consumers to interact with 3D models of products before purchasing. 
        This lets shoppers virtually explore items in their own environments, enhancing the online shopping experience by making it more immersive and informative even without visiting a store in person. 
        In the beauty industry specifically this has been a major development as beauty products.
